Aggregate Functions

Aim :
   To write a program to demonstrate of aggregate Functions.
Description:
    In addition to simply retrieving data , we often want to perform some computation or summarization .SQL allows the use of arithmetic expressions . We now consider a powerful class of contracts for computing aggregate values such as min and sum.

*SUM :
     It is used to get sum value of a numeric column ( single column).
Syntax: select sum (condition) from <table name>;
Ex : select sum (esal) from emp;

*AVERAGE :
    It is used to get avg value of a numeric column.
Syntax: select avg(condition) from <table name>;
Ex: select avg(esal) from emp;

*MAX :
    It is used to get max value of a numeric column.
Syntax: select max(condition) from < table name>;
Ex: select max( esal ) from emp;

*MIN :
     it is used to get min value of a numeric column.
Syntax: select min(condition) from <table name>;
Ex: select min(esal) from emp;

*COUNT :
    It is used to get the no. Of records in a table.
Syntax: select count (emp) from <table name> where <condition>;
Ex: select count (eno) from emp;
