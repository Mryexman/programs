==> Using cocomo model estimate effort for banking or online book store domain problem.

Aim :
      The aim of this effort estimation is to provide a quantitative assessment of the person months required for the development of the project in the banking or online book store domain using the cocomo ( constructive cost model ) techniques. The estimattion will be based on specified project characteristics including the size of the codebase, development flexibility, required reliability and complexity .

Procedure :

Given values :

         Size = 20,000 lines of code
       Development flexibility = normal
       Required reliability = high
      Complexity = organic ( average )

* Cocomo parameter =  a=2.4 , b=1.05

* Effort adjustment factor ( EAF ) based on development flexibility, required reliability and other factors, let's assume EAF = 1.0

Conclusion:
          The effort estimation for the banking or online book store using the cocomo model yeilds on approximate requirements of 54,791.64 person months.

Calculation : 
Effort= ax ( size )b x EAF 
Where a = 2.4
     b = 1.05
     Size = 20,000 lines of code
     EAF = 1.0

==> Calculation of size terms ( size b) 
  ( 20,000 )1.05 = 22,829.85

==> Now effort estimation
Effort= ax(size)b x EAF
           = 2.4 x 22,829.85 x 1.0
           = 54,791.64 person months.
